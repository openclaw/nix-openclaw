# Performance Audit

Append-only measurement ledger for default stable `openclaw` /
`openclaw-gateway` packaging. Runtime plugin shrinkwrap is tracked separately
in the plugin PR.

## Rules

- Add a new run when packaging, CI shape, or release-update behavior changes.
- Do not overwrite old run rows. If a value was wrong, add a correction row with
  the correcting commit.
- Tie every run to a commit SHA. Use the commit whose package/check graph was
  measured, not a later prose-only commit.
- Keep metric rows concrete: baseline provenance, measured provenance, command,
  value, and change.

## Runs

### `pr100-npm-default-2026-06-05`

- PR: `#100`
- Measured commit: `aaadab2da7c2dbfeebe08d287999c87ae969747a`
- Base commit: `561aa2809a9cbfc9ba7b86c02b5796cd71937ecc`
- Package outputs:
  - baseline gateway: `/nix/store/a0ky4lhljzsjcbip97ykpjnj29lcf5q9-openclaw-gateway-unstable-2e08f0f4`
  - baseline `openclaw`: `/nix/store/3i3xlpx2pysv076gz3f9yjsx5rv9czwd-openclaw-2026.6.1`
  - measured gateway: `/nix/store/kh5j0cgbihmz4cl67w6fy0j4kimqcj70-openclaw-gateway-2026.6.1`
  - measured `openclaw`: `/nix/store/sflqabvcsphsqn6s11nw82la3gafzp0a-openclaw-2026.6.1`
- Notes:
  - Size baselines compare the old source-build gateway output to the npm
    gateway output.
  - Workflow/check baselines compare earlier draft PR state before the
    simplification pass.

Remote proof for measured commit:

- GitHub Actions Linux: pass.
- GitHub Actions macOS: pass.
- Garnix: pass on 5 targets: Darwin CI, stable `openclaw` and
  `openclaw-gateway` packages on Darwin and Linux.
